# subzero

This library was created to provide an intuitive description for
straightforward problems like fizzbuzz.

In the case of fizzbuzz, there is an indexed space which has an
answer at each point. Ideally we should be able to describe the
solution in those terms.

In general this library ends up supporting concepts like containers
of optional values, nondeterministic values, etc.

It's a small library and once perfected, probably ought to be
a basic facility for anyone from an imperative background.
